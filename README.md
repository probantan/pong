## Description
THis game is called ping pong..It inludes the numger 3 and 5 in a way that when the number is divisible ny 
3 then it is set to display Ping. And when number is divisible by 5 is set to display pong..But when 
the number is both  divisible by both then it is set to display pingpong...However when either of
the numbers are not divisible by both 3 and 5 then it is set to just display the number instead.
### Installation reguirements
For intallation requirements , you can go to google, go to my appstore.  The name search should be "PIng Pong"
##known bugs
 The app is effective and one that you can depend on..However you should thats this game can only be played  by one person at a go and not two or three
 This application is created using the lastest and preferable version..I have used the updatedd javascript 4.4.1 for this app. Css and html being the basics, javacript is very interesting language to interact with for it is responsible of all the motion objects you might see in the application...It operates literally many functions
